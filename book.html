    <h1>â€‹"SET A READING GOAL"</h1>
  <p> Cultivating a habit of reading books offers a plethora of
     benefits. Beyond the acquisition of knowledge, regular
      reading enhances focus, expands vocabulary, and provides 
      a valuable mental break, contributing to stress reduction.
      It fosters critical thinking, refines writing skills, and
       stimulates cognitive function.My favourite book is ALCHEIST and i have read harry
    potter novels now my  current book is DEEP WORK </p>
